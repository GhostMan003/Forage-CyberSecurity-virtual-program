Here you have one zip file named "EncryptedFilePack".
First, unzip the above file.
Inside the file is one zip file named enc.zip, and one Python script that does not entirely complete brute-force Python code.
Modify the code, then, using the code, unzip the "enc.zip" file, and then submit the code in the submit section.
